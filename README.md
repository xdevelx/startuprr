# Gulp Starter 

Gulp starter is my front-end framework using Gulp, Node, Sass, SourceMaps, Browser-Sync, Autoprefixer and Uglify / Concat. 

## Install Packages

After cloning the project to your computer run the following command in your terminal to install all required node and bower packages.

	1.   npm install	
		

## Start

	gulp

## Build

Create a build with the following commands:
```bash
 gulp build
```
```bash
 sudo rm
```

## gulpfile.js
Javascript concatenation is done in the config object in the guilpfile.  This controls the order as well as files **bold** to be be concatenated.  I went with a simple system in anticipation of ES6 built-in modules.
